**Stats 140XP Final Project** 
*Data Analyst and Presenter*

Set out to find possible factors that contribute to a local government being listed as "high risk" and if we could predict fiscal risks in the future using past audit data 

Performed exploratory data analysis, cleaned the data, and constructed visualizations to examine the distribution of each variable 

Created statistical models such as using logistic regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to examine feature importance 

Drew conclusions on the factors that are contributing to governments being "high risk" and summarized the potential impact
