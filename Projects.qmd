## Project 1 

**Kaggle Competition: Obesity Status Prediction**

*Data Analyst* 

Utilized a training set consisting of 32,000 observations with 29 total predictors and cleaned data 

Selected the best predictors using various methods, such as the BIC, for variable selection and found the VIF

Ultimately used a Random Forest model with 10 trees, receiving a final r-squared score of 0.96 for the testing data set

## Project 4 

Set out to find possible factors that contribute to a local government being listed as "high risk" and if we could predict fiscal risks in the future using past audit data 

Performed exploratory data analysis, cleaned the data, and constructed visualizations to examine the distribution of each variable 

Created statistical models such as using logistic regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to examine feature importance 

Drew conclusions on the factors that are contributing to governments being "high risk" and summarized the potential impact
